Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Daytrip took it to ten (yeah)

'Cause I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light) (woo)
'Cause I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light) (yeah)
I'm surrounded by the people I don't like (I don't like) (yeah)
They wanna see me wrong, I make it right (make it right)
When I fuck around a bitch you know I might (know I might) (yeah)
When I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light) (yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you know me I'm gon' show you how I fight (how I fight) (yeah)
'Cause they wanna see me wrong, I make it right (make it right)

I believe in risk and reward
Heard if you get the key to the city it fit every door
White glove and fedora
Know you're convinced that you're moonwalkin'
I know you just movin' backwards
Niggas focused on the small time
'Bout the juice, worried about who has it
Jumpin' out the front seat
Got the Lamborghini lookin' like the Dukes of Hazzard
I can make your bitch a dream come true
Heard they lookin' for a new Aladdin
Ayy, hit up V-Live, shake that ass, find you a rapper
You can't rub no lamp, find no genie, that shit don't happen
You can't trust every tramp at your crib and I'm still adaptin'
When I drop my PIN, she said, "why that shit go to Saturn?"
I'ma let you in 'cause you said my heart won't get shattered
You're like Harley Quinn, you got jokes and I'm very flattered then

'Cause I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light)
'Cause I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light)
I'm surrounded by the people I don't like (I don't like)
They wanna see me wrong, I make it right (make it right)
When I fuck around a bitch you know I might (know I might)
When I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light)
If you know me I'm gon' show you how I fight (how I fight)
(Yeah) 'cause they wanna see me wrong, I make it right (make it right) (yeah)

I fucked things up with my girl one too many times
She hold three fingers up and told me, "Read between the lines"
I know I was born to shine, they look at this look like the mines
I told that girl to sober up, her expectations way too high
She want a boo, get her in, and now she in and out my life
Every summer I'll be single, every winter have a wife
I just keep it rollin'-rollin', every day I'm rollin' dice
I simply don't waste no food, I ain't in to throwing rice
She swear that the paper change me, I got way more impolite
Blue asses is what I like, blue dollar signs, ain't no Skype
The ALS challenge, every single day covered in ice
You wonder how I do what I do, they scratch they head like lice

'Cause I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light)
'Cause I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light)
(Yeah) I'm surrounded by the people I don't like (I don't like) (yeah)
They wanna see me wrong, I make it right (make it right)
When I fuck around a bitch you know I might (know I might) (yeah)
When I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light) (yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you know me I'm gon' show you how I fight (how I fight) (yeah)
'Cause they wanna see me wrong, I make it right (make it right)

I done fucked around for a minute
Burning through the ground like I'm acidic
If I'm up with the judges I'm a critic
Now I'm blendin' with the colors, I'm acrylic

'Cause I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light)
'Cause I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light)
I'm surrounded by the people I don't like (I don't like)
They wanna see me wrong, I make it right (make it right)
When I fuck around a bitch you know I might (know I might)
When I'm rollin' through the smoke without a light (without a light)
If you know me I'm gon' show you how I fight (how I fight)
'Cause they wanna see me wrong, I make it right, make it right

Without a light
Without a light
Without a light
I make it right
